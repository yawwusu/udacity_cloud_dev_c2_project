# Udacity Cloud Developer Course 2 (UDAGRAM)

## Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. The Simple Frontend
A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend. 
2. The RestAPI Backend, a Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service. 
3. The Image Filtering Microservice, the final project for the course. It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images. 


### Setup Node Environment

You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Includes:

<!-- ### RESTapi

If you're feeling up to it, refactor the course RESTapi to make a request to your newly provisioned image server.

### Authentication

Prevent requests without valid authentication headers.

### Custom Domain Name

Add your own domain name and have it point to the running services (try adding a subdomain name to point to the processing server) -->
